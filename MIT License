# Pill Dispensing System with ESP8266

This project is a pill dispensing system using an ESP8266 microcontroller. The system is designed to dispense pills either manually through a button press or automatically based on a set interval. It includes an OLED display to show status and remaining time until the next automatic dispensing.

## Features

- **Manual Dispensing:** Press a button to manually dispense a pill.
- **Automatic Dispensing:** Set an interval to automatically dispense pills.
- **OLED Display:** Shows WiFi connection status, IP address, and time remaining until the next automatic dispense.
- **Web Interface:** Control the pill dispenser and set the dispensing interval via a simple web interface.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 (e.g., NodeMCU)
- Servo Motor
- OLED Display (SSD1306)
- Push Button
- WiFi Network

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE with the following libraries:
  - `ESP8266WiFi`
  - `ESP8266WebServer`
  - `Servo`
  - `Adafruit_GFX`
  - `Adafruit_SSD1306`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your ESP8266.
4. Connect the hardware as per the wiring diagram.
5. Open the serial monitor to find the IP address and access the web interface.

## Usage

1. Power on the ESP8266 and connect to the WiFi network.
2. Open the web interface in a browser using the IP address displayed on the OLED.
3. Use the interface to dispense pills or set the interval for automatic dispensing.
